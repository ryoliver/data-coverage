## goals:
Rework coverage workflow to support wider applications
* establish core functions
* create better flexibility for occurrence datasets
* support wider taxonomic and geographic scope
* generate output which stores metadata

## to do:
* establish repo on HPC
* separate functions from main script

## activity log:
